  abstract     = {We evaluated the reproducibility of the  C-phenylalanine breath test ( C-PheBT). On three separate days, 21 healthy volunteers (11 F and 10 M) underwent  C-PheBT with 100 mg l-[1- C]phenylalanine taken orally. Short-term reproducibility was evaluated with paired examinations taken 3 days apart; paired examinations separated by 23 days (median) served for the medium-term reproducibility assessment. Expiratory air was sampled at 19 points throughout 3 h. Determined limited reproducibility of the  C-PheBT must be taken into consideration while interpreting the results of this diagnostic tool. The results of this study imply the following conclusions: (i) From among the three parameters examined, the cumulative  C recovery area under the curve (AUC) offers much better reproducibility than the maximum momentary  C recovery in the expiratory air (D ) or the time to reach the maximum momentary  C recovery (T ) (ii) Collection of the breath air samples for 2 h results in a much better reproducibility of AUC, than for 1 h only; (iii) Reproducibility of  C-PheBT is affected neither by the duration of the time gap between repeated tests nor by gender; (iv) Comparison with data obtained formerly reveals that reproducibility of the  C-PheBT is worse than either that of of the  C-methacetin ( C-MBT) or the  C-alpha-ketoisocaproic acic ( C-KICA-BT) breath tests. This finding will have to be taken into consideration while interpreting the results of this diagnostic tool.},

  abstract        = {The objective of this study was to investigate whether the 13C-phenylalanine breath test could be useful for the evaluation of hepatic function in elderly volunteers and patients with chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. L-[1-13C] phenylalanine was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg to 55 elderly patients with liver cirrhosis, 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 38 elderly healthy subjects. The breath test was performed at 8 different time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min) to obtain the values of Delta over baseline, percentage 13CO2 exhalation rate and cumulative excretion (Cum). The relationships of the cumulative excretion with the 13C-%dose/h and blood biochemical parameters were investigated. The 13C-%dose/h at 20 min and 30 min combined with the cumulative excretion at 60 min and 120 min correlated with hepatic function tests, serum albumin, hemoglobin, platelet and Child-Pugh score. Prothrombin time, total and direct bilirubin were significantly increased, while serum albumin, hemoglobin and platelet, the cumulative excretion at 60 min and 120 min values decreased by degrees of intensity of the disease in Child-Pugh A, B, and C patients (P < 0.01). The 13C-phenylalanine breath test can be used as a non-invasive assay to evaluate hepatic function in elderly patients with liver cirrhosis. The 13C-%dose/h at 20 min, at 30 min and cumulative excretion at 60 min may be the key value for determination at a single time-point. 13C-phenylalanine breath test is safe and helpful in distinguishing different stages of hepatic dysfunction for elderly cirrhosis patients.},

No differences in CPDR were found considering the Child-Pugh (CP) class or etiology: alcoholic (CP A=7.7+/-0.7, CP B=4.1+/-0.5, CP C=2.0+/-0.3), hepatitis C virus (CP A=5.4+/-0.5, CP B=4.0+/-0.2, CP C=2.2+/-0.3), hepatocellular carcinoma (CP A=5.5+/-1.6, CP B=3.6+/-1.8, CP C=2.2+/-1.0); or cryptogenic cirrhotic patients (CP A=7.4+/-1.5, CP B=4.4+/-0.4, CP C=2.1+/-0.7). Results confirm that (13)C-PheOx decreases in patients with cirrhosis with respect to controls, notwithstanding the etiology.},

A total of seven trained male cyclists completed two trials, separated by 7 d. Each trial involved 2 h of standardised intermittent cycling, followed by 4 h recovery. During recovery, one of two isoenergetic formulations, MD-GAL (0.9 g MD/kg body mass (BM) per h and 0.3 g GAL/kg BM per h) or MD-GAL-PRO+AA (0.5 g MD/kg BM per h, 0.3 g GAL/kg BM per h, 0.4 g whey PRO hydrolysate plus l-leucine and l-phenylalanine/kg BM per h) was ingested at every 30 min. Liver and muscle glycogen were measured after depletion exercise and at the end of recovery using 1H-13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Despite higher postprandial insulin concentations for MD-GAL-PRO+AA compared with MD-GAL (61.3 (se 6.2) v. 29.6 (se 3.0) mU/l, (425.8 (se 43.1) v. 205.6 (se 20.8) pmol/l) P= 0.03), there were no significant differences in post-recovery liver (195.3 (se 2.6) v. 213.8 (se 18.0) mmol/l) or muscle glycogen concentrations (49.7 (se 4.0) v. 51.1 (se 7.9) mmol/l). The rate of muscle glycogen repletion was significantly higher for MD-GAL compared with MD-GAL-PRO+AA (5.8 (se 0.7) v. 3.7 (se 0.6) mmol/l per h, P= 0.04), while there were no significant differences in the rate of liver glycogen repletion (15.0 (se 2.5) v. 13.0 (se 2.7) mmol/l per h). PRO and AA within a MD-GAL recovery drink, compared with an isoenergetic mix of MD-GAL, did not enhance but matched liver and muscle glycogen recovery. This suggests that the increased postprandial insulinaemia only compensated for the lower MD content in the MD-GAL-PRO+AA treatment.},

Most commonly, the diagnostics is based on measurements of static biochemical parameters, which allow us to draw conclusions only indirectly about the function and the degree of damage of the organ. On the other hand, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure and therefore it is associated with a considerable risk of complications. Dynamic tests enable us to assess quantitatively the organ's functional reserve by analyzing the kinetics of the metabolization of the substrate by the liver. In practice applied are breath tests using substances such as aminopyrine, caffeine, methacetin, erythromycin (for assessment of the microsomal function); phenylalanine, galactose (for assessment of the cytosolic function); methionine, octanoate, ketoisocaproic acid (for assessment of the mitochondrial function). The test with  C methacetin belongs to the best described and most widely applied methods in noninvasive liver function assessment. Due to the rising availability of this method, knowledge concerning its limitations and controversies regarding the methodology, as well as its usefulness in chosen groups of patients, seems to be vital.},

  abstract        = {A 13C breath test was applied to evaluate the early stage of postoperative liver function after hepatectomy. It was examined in comparison with functional and morphological recovery. Rats were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy (H group) and control group (S group). Expired air, blood and remnant liver tissue were collected at 12, 24, 48 and 72h, and 7 and 14 days postoperatively. Phenylalanine and leucine were used as the 13C-labeled substrates. The 13CO2 was collected until 120min. The mean values of the H and S groups were compared using the highest mean level of 13CO2 excreted in breath (Cmax). The liver regenerative ability was evaluated by Ki-67. In the 13C-phenylalanine breath test, the Cmax value tended to be lower for the H group 12h postoperatively (p=0.06). Cmax was significantly lower for the H group 24h postoperatively (p<0.05). Both groups showed equal recovery at 48h postoperatively. In the 13C-leucine breath test, both groups had no significant difference after hepatectomy. The peak of Ki-67 positive rate is estimated to be at 52.8h postoperatively, meaning that the time difference was only approximately 5h between the peak time of Ki-67 positive rate and the 13C-phenylalanine breath test. These results strongly support that the 13C-phenylalanine breath test can become a non-invasive indicator to evaluate the early stage of postoperative liver function after hepatectomy.},

  abstract        = {It has been demonstrated by other investigators that central plasma clearance of amino acids accurately predicts hepatocyte function in patients with liver disease and correlates with clinical outcome. This methodology has not heretofore been studied in the trauma patient. It is our hypothesis that central amino acid clearance in trauma patients is more reflective of hepatocyte function than traditional liver function tests. We examined the plasma amino acid clearance rates using L-[1-13C]phenylalanine. Clearance rates were compared to standard liver function tests (LFTs) and the sensitivity and predictability of the technique were determined. The study was conducted on uninjured control subjects and in seriously injured patients, both with and without significant liver injuries. Compared to baseline values in the control group, initial phenylalanine breath scores were reduced in the injured, but exceeded control levels at 7 days postinjury. These changes were statistically significant. There was no difference between those with and without liver trauma. LFTs showed inconsistent and conflicting results. Thus, central amino acid clearance measured by L-[1-13C]phenylalanine oxidation is depressed immediately following injury but reaches supranormal levels at 7 days postinjury. Compared to LFTs, amino acid clearance suggests initial hepatocyte suppression followed by hyperactivity and is a more accurate determinant of hepatocyte function.},
