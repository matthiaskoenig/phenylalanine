  abstract     = {We evaluated the reproducibility of the  C-phenylalanine breath test ( C-PheBT). On three separate days, 21 healthy volunteers (11 F and 10 M) underwent  C-PheBT with 100 mg l-[1- C]phenylalanine taken orally. Short-term reproducibility was evaluated with paired examinations taken 3 days apart; paired examinations separated by 23 days (median) served for the medium-term reproducibility assessment. Expiratory air was sampled at 19 points throughout 3 h. Determined limited reproducibility of the  C-PheBT must be taken into consideration while interpreting the results of this diagnostic tool. The results of this study imply the following conclusions: (i) From among the three parameters examined, the cumulative  C recovery area under the curve (AUC) offers much better reproducibility than the maximum momentary  C recovery in the expiratory air (D ) or the time to reach the maximum momentary  C recovery (T ) (ii) Collection of the breath air samples for 2 h results in a much better reproducibility of AUC, than for 1 h only; (iii) Reproducibility of  C-PheBT is affected neither by the duration of the time gap between repeated tests nor by gender; (iv) Comparison with data obtained formerly reveals that reproducibility of the  C-PheBT is worse than either that of of the  C-methacetin ( C-MBT) or the  C-alpha-ketoisocaproic acic ( C-KICA-BT) breath tests. This finding will have to be taken into consideration while interpreting the results of this diagnostic tool.},

  abstract        = {The objective of this study was to investigate whether the 13C-phenylalanine breath test could be useful for the evaluation of hepatic function in elderly volunteers and patients with chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. L-[1-13C] phenylalanine was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg to 55 elderly patients with liver cirrhosis, 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 38 elderly healthy subjects. The breath test was performed at 8 different time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min) to obtain the values of Delta over baseline, percentage 13CO2 exhalation rate and cumulative excretion (Cum). The relationships of the cumulative excretion with the 13C-%dose/h and blood biochemical parameters were investigated. The 13C-%dose/h at 20 min and 30 min combined with the cumulative excretion at 60 min and 120 min correlated with hepatic function tests, serum albumin, hemoglobin, platelet and Child-Pugh score. Prothrombin time, total and direct bilirubin were significantly increased, while serum albumin, hemoglobin and platelet, the cumulative excretion at 60 min and 120 min values decreased by degrees of intensity of the disease in Child-Pugh A, B, and C patients (P < 0.01). The 13C-phenylalanine breath test can be used as a non-invasive assay to evaluate hepatic function in elderly patients with liver cirrhosis. The 13C-%dose/h at 20 min, at 30 min and cumulative excretion at 60 min may be the key value for determination at a single time-point. 13C-phenylalanine breath test is safe and helpful in distinguishing different stages of hepatic dysfunction for elderly cirrhosis patients.},

Breath samples were collected before the administration of 100 mg L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine, and every 10 min thereafter until completion of 1 h. Control subjects (n=9) presented a larger cumulative percentage of (13)C dose recovery (CPDR) than patients (n=124) with chronic liver disease, regardless of the etiology (7.5+/-0.7 vs. 4.2+/-0.2, p=0.001). No differences in CPDR were found considering the Child-Pugh (CP) class or etiology: alcoholic (CP A=7.7+/-0.7, CP B=4.1+/-0.5, CP C=2.0+/-0.3), hepatitis C virus (CP A=5.4+/-0.5, CP B=4.0+/-0.2, CP C=2.2+/-0.3), hepatocellular carcinoma (CP A=5.5+/-1.6, CP B=3.6+/-1.8, CP C=2.2+/-1.0); or cryptogenic cirrhotic patients (CP A=7.4+/-1.5, CP B=4.4+/-0.4, CP C=2.1+/-0.7). Results confirm that (13)C-PheOx decreases in patients with cirrhosis with respect to controls, notwithstanding the etiology.},

Twelve adults received [13C2]aminopyrine and L-[1-13C]phenylalanine together with a standardised dinner. Expired air samples were taken over 6 h. After a wash-out period, the subjects consumed 0.4 ml ethanol per kg per day together with dinner over a 7.5-day period on average. Thereafter, 13C-tracer administration was repeated under identical conditions. The 13CO2 enrichments were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The mean cumulative percentage 13C-dose recovery after administration of [13C2]aminopyrine and L-[1-13C]phenylalanine either without or with red wine consumption amounted to 17.0+/-4.4 vs. 14.7+/-3.1% (p=0.170) and 14.0+/-2.8 vs. 11.5+/-3.9% (p=0.084), respectively.

  abstract        = {The present study evaluated whether the inclusion of protein (PRO) and amino acids (AA) within a maltodextrin (MD) and galactose (GAL) recovery drink enhanced post-exercise liver and muscle glycogen repletion. A total of seven trained male cyclists completed two trials, separated by 7 d. Each trial involved 2 h of standardised intermittent cycling, followed by 4 h recovery. During recovery, one of two isoenergetic formulations, MD-GAL (0.9 g MD/kg body mass (BM) per h and 0.3 g GAL/kg BM per h) or MD-GAL-PRO+AA (0.5 g MD/kg BM per h, 0.3 g GAL/kg BM per h, 0.4 g whey PRO hydrolysate plus l-leucine and l-phenylalanine/kg BM per h) was ingested at every 30 min. Liver and muscle glycogen were measured after depletion exercise and at the end of recovery using 1H-13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Despite higher postprandial insulin concentations for MD-GAL-PRO+AA compared with MD-GAL (61.3 (se 6.2) v. 29.6 (se 3.0) mU/l, (425.8 (se 43.1) v. 205.6 (se 20.8) pmol/l) P= 0.03), there were no significant differences in post-recovery liver (195.3 (se 2.6) v. 213.8 (se 18.0) mmol/l) or muscle glycogen concentrations (49.7 (se 4.0) v. 51.1 (se 7.9) mmol/l). The rate of muscle glycogen repletion was significantly higher for MD-GAL compared with MD-GAL-PRO+AA (5.8 (se 0.7) v. 3.7 (se 0.6) mmol/l per h, P= 0.04), while there were no significant differences in the rate of liver glycogen repletion (15.0 (se 2.5) v. 13.0 (se 2.7) mmol/l per h). PRO and AA within a MD-GAL recovery drink, compared with an isoenergetic mix of MD-GAL, did not enhance but matched liver and muscle glycogen recovery. This suggests that the increased postprandial insulinaemia only compensated for the lower MD content in the MD-GAL-PRO+AA treatment.},

  abstract      = {Assessment of the liver function, and the need of constant monitoring of the organ's capacity, concerns not only patients with primary liver diseases, but also those at risk of hepatopathies secondary to other chronic diseases. Most commonly, the diagnostics is based on measurements of static biochemical parameters, which allow us to draw conclusions only indirectly about the function and the degree of damage of the organ. On the other hand, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure and therefore it is associated with a considerable risk of complications. Dynamic tests enable us to assess quantitatively the organ's functional reserve by analyzing the kinetics of the metabolization of the substrate by the liver. In practice applied are breath tests using substances such as aminopyrine, caffeine, methacetin, erythromycin (for assessment of the microsomal function); phenylalanine, galactose (for assessment of the cytosolic function); methionine, octanoate, ketoisocaproic acid (for assessment of the mitochondrial function). The test with  C methacetin belongs to the best described and most widely applied methods in noninvasive liver function assessment. Due to the rising availability of this method, knowledge concerning its limitations and controversies regarding the methodology, as well as its usefulness in chosen groups of patients, seems to be vital.},
